### State Management

- **Timer State:** currentTime, currentRep, isRunning, isResting, currentSegment
- **Plan State:** activePlanId, planType (simple/preset/custom), smartRepetition
- **YouTube State:** player instance, isReady, currentVideoId, lazy-loaded
- **Audio State:**
  - Web Audio API beeps: audioContext, vibrationEnabled, volumeDucking
  - Sound Effects: preloaded MP3s (whistle, bell, three bells), active clones tracking
  - Callback-based timing: timer waits for transition sounds to finish
  - Memory management: automatic cleanup of cloned audio elements
- **Settings State:** Persisted in localStorage, auto-saved on change
- **Library State:** Song play history, play counts, timestamps (localStorage)
- **Favorites State:** Favorited songs with metadata (localStorage)
- **Plans State:** Custom plans, active plan, usage stats (localStorage)
- **Music Library:** 18 categories (8 moods + 10 genres) with metadata
- **Wake Lock:** Screen wake lock status for mobile devices

### Workout Plans System

The app includes a sophisticated workout plan system:

**Preset Plans** (`/src/js/modules/plans/presets.js`):
- 12 professionally designed workout programs
- Each includes: name, description, duration, segments array
- Metadata: intensity level, category, focus areas
- Easy duplication and modification

**Segment Type System** (`/src/js/modules/plans/segment-types.js`):
- 26 segment types organized in 6 categories
- Each type includes: name, description, category, intensity, sound cues
- Supports custom durations per segment
- Icons and colors for visual identification

**Plan Storage** (`/src/js/modules/plans/storage.js`):
- Full CRUD operations for custom plans
- Active plan tracking and persistence
- Plan usage statistics and sorting
- Export/import as JSON
- Validation and error handling

**Smart Repetition** (`/src/js/modules/timer.js`):
- Category-based segment filtering
- Automatic recovery insertion (30s between rounds)
- Round counter with display
- Timer integration with segment progression
- Works with all plan types

### Music Library System

The app includes a sophisticated music curation system:

**song_fetcher.js** (Backend automation):
- YouTube Data API v3 integration with quota management
- Fetches 10 verified tracks per category (180+ total)
- Filters: 30+ minute videos, 10K+ views, no live/upcoming
- Auto-refresh every 30 days for policy compliance
- Rate limiting: 250ms between requests, 9000 unit daily budget
- Outputs: `workout_music.json` (clean) + `workout_music_cache.json` (timestamps)

**music-library.js** (Frontend API):
- Imports curated JSON data
- Provides functions: `getMoodPlaylists()`, `getGenreSongs()`, `getRandomSong()`
- Handles duplicate detection across categories
- Powers mood/genre selection UI

**Error Handling**:
- Error 150 (embedding disabled) detection
- Auto-loads random alternative track from library
- User notifications for errors and recoveries

### Version Check System

The app includes robust client-server version synchronization with visual feedback:

**Build-Time Generation** (`scripts/generate-version.js`):
- Reads version from `package.json` (single source of truth)
- Generates `version.json` with version, build time, build ID
- Runs automatically before every dev/build command
- Injected into client code via Vite define plugin

**Dynamic Version Display**:
- Version number in HTML header auto-updates on app load
- Reads from embedded `__APP_VERSION__` constant
- Single source of truth eliminates hardcoded versions
- Always displays current version from package.json

**Client-Side Checking** (`src/js/utils/version-check.js`):
- Fetches `/version.json` from server with cache-busting
- Compares client version (injected at build) with server version
- Checks every 5 minutes for active users
- Initial check on app load

**Visual Update Overlay**:
When version mismatch detected, displays animated cyberpunk overlay with:
- **Version Transition** - Shows old version → new version (e.g., `v1.0.4 → v1.0.5`)
- **Animated Icon** - Rotating, pulsing cyberpunk logo with color shifts
- **Progress Steps** - 3 animated steps with checkmarks:
    1. ✓ Clearing caches... (spins while active)
    2. ✓ Preserving your data... (spins while active)
    3. ✓ Loading new version... (spins while active)
- **Smooth Animations** - Cyan/pink glows, slide-ins, checkmark pops
- **Professional UX** - Users see exactly what's happening during update

**Force Update Flow**:
1. Version mismatch detected
2. Show visual update overlay with version numbers
3. Step 1: Unregister service workers + clear caches (animated)
4. Step 2: Preserve user data (`cycleSettings`, `cycleHistory`, `cycleFavorites`, `cyclePlans`) (animated)
5. Step 3: Reload with cache-busting parameter (animated)
6. Page reloads with new version (~3-4 seconds total)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Guarantees users run latest deployed version
- ✅ Critical fixes reach users immediately
- ✅ Prevents stale cache issues
- ✅ User data survives updates (settings, history, favorites, plans)
- ✅ Professional visual feedback during updates
- ✅ Clear communication (shows old → new version)
- ✅ Branded cyberpunk aesthetic maintained

## 🚀 Why Vanilla JavaScript?

This project deliberately avoids frameworks for several advantages:

1. **Performance** - Direct DOM manipulation, no virtual DOM overhead
2. **Bundle Size** - Minimal overhead vs. 40KB+ for React alone
3. **Simplicity** - Single-page app doesn't need complex state management
4. **Learning** - Standard JavaScript, no framework-specific concepts
5. **Native APIs** - Direct access to Web Audio, YouTube, Vibration, Wake Lock, Popover APIs
6. **Future-Proof** - No framework versioning or breaking changes

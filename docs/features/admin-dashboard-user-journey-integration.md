## Data Flow

### User Data
```javascript

const users = await posthog.getUsers(30, 100);

// Returns array of:
{
  userId: "0199f461-30c2-777d-b444-2cfcaf7c0f64",
  totalEvents: 107,
  firstSeen: Date(2025-10-17T22:53:55),
  lastSeen: Date(2025-10-18T09:38:17),
  workouts: 3,
  songsPlayed: 4,
  sessions: 2,
  daysActive: 1
}
```

### User Activity
```javascript
// Fetched when clicking a user
const activity = await posthog.getUserActivity(userId, 100);

// Returns array of:
{
  event: "music_played",
  timestamp: Date(2025-10-18T09:38:17),
  properties: { videoId: "...", title: "..." }
}
```

### Events Data
```javascript
// Fetched for event breakdown
const events = await posthog.getTopEvents(30, 20);

// Returns array of:
{
  event: "session_started",
  count: 45
}
```

---

## Auto-Refresh

Both sections update automatically with the dashboard's 30-second refresh cycle:

```javascript
refreshInterval = setInterval(() => {
  renderDashboard(); // Includes user and event sections
}, 30000);
```

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

**Tablet (768px and below):**
- Event grid becomes single column
- Timeline events stack vertically
- Modal becomes full-screen
- Reduced padding for better space usage

**Mobile (smaller screens):**
- User table scrolls horizontally
- Event cards full width
- Timeline simplified layout
- Touch-friendly tap targets

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Async Loading** - Sections load in parallel
2. **Lazy Rendering** - Only render visible elements
3. **Grouped Queries** - Minimize API calls
4. **Cached Icons** - Icon class mapping cached
5. **Virtual Scrolling** - Efficient timeline rendering

---

## Error Handling

### User Section Errors
```javascript
try {
  await renderUsersSection();
} catch (error) {
  // Shows error card with message
  // Console logs full error
  // Doesn't crash dashboard
}
```

### Event Section Errors
```javascript
try {
  await renderEventsSection();
} catch (error) {
  // Shows error card with icon
  // Displays error message
  // Continues loading other sections
}
```

### Empty States
- **No users**: "No users found" message with icon
- **No events**: "No events yet" message with icon
- **No activity**: "No recent activity" empty state

# Favorites Fix, Shuffle Rename, and Import/Export Removal

## Date
2025-10-15

## Changes Made

### 1. Favorites Not Working in Recent Songs and Genre Popup

**Problem:**
- Adding/removing songs to/from favorites from recent songs list didn't work
- Adding/removing songs to/from favorites from genre popup didn't work
- Favorites functionality worked from other places

**Root Cause:**
In `/src/js/utils/favorite-button.js`, the `extractSongData` function was returning a property named `author`, but the favorites storage module (`/src/js/modules/favorites/storage.js`) expected a property named `channel`.

**Fix:**
Changed line 122 in `/src/js/utils/favorite-button.js` from:
```javascript
const author = authorEl ? authorEl.textContent.trim() : element.dataset.author || "Unknown Artist";
```
to:
```javascript
const channel = authorEl ? authorEl.textContent.trim() : element.dataset.channel || "Unknown Channel";
```

And updated the return object at line 136 from:
```javascript
return {
  videoId,
  title,
  author,  // ‚ùå Wrong property name
  duration,
  url: url || `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}`,
  thumbnail: element.dataset.thumbnail || `https://img.youtube.com/vi/${videoId}/mqdefault.jpg`
};
```
to:
```javascript
return {
  videoId,
  title,
  channel,  // ‚úÖ Correct property name
  duration,
  url: url || `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}`,
  thumbnail: element.dataset.thumbnail || `https://img.youtube.com/vi/${videoId}/mqdefault.jpg`
};
```

### 2. Rename "Shuffle" to "Random"

**Problem:**
User requested to rename all references from "Shuffle" to "Random" throughout the codebase.

**Changes Made:**

1. **HTML** - `/src/partials/popovers/music-library.html` (line 18-20):
   - Changed button text from "Shuffle" to "Random"
   - Changed tooltip from "Shuffle favorites" to "Random"

2. **JavaScript** - `/src/js/modules/favorites-ui/actions.js`:
   - Line 2: Updated header comment from "shuffle, export, import" to "random, export, import"
   - Line 20: Changed comment from "Shuffle favorites" to "Random favorites"
   - Line 26: Changed notification text from "No favorites to shuffle" to "No favorites to randomize"
   - Line 54: Changed notification text from "Shuffling favorites: ${title}" to "Playing random favorite: ${title}"

3. **JavaScript** - `/src/js/ui/library-ui.js` (line 54):
   - Updated comment from "shuffle, export, import" to "random, export, import"

4. **CSS** - `/src/css/components/favorites/favorites-buttons.css` (line 170):
   - Changed comment from "Shuffle Button Specific" to "Random Button Specific"

   - Removed `updateFavoritesBadge` import (no longer needed)
   - Updated header comment from "random, export, import" to just "random"

3. **JavaScript** - `/src/js/modules/favorites/index.js`:
   - Removed exports of `exportFavorites`, `importFavorites`, `downloadFavoritesFile`, `uploadFavoritesFile`
   - Removed import statement from `./import-export.js`

4. **File Deletion**:
   - Deleted `/src/js/modules/favorites/import-export.js` (feature no longer needed)

5. **README.md** - Updated all mentions:
   - Line 51: Changed "üîÄ **Shuffle Favorites**" to "üîÄ **Random Favorites**"

3. `/src/js/modules/favorites-ui/actions.js` - Updated comments, notification messages, and removed export/import handlers
4. `/src/js/ui/library-ui.js` - Updated comment
5. `/src/css/components/favorites/favorites-buttons.css` - Updated comment

## Files Deleted

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test adding/removing favorites from:
   - Recent songs list
   - Genre popup
   - Mood popup
   - Search results
   - Currently playing song

2. Verify the "Random" button:
   - Button displays "Random" instead of "Shuffle"
   - Tooltip shows "Random" instead of "Shuffle favorites"
   - Notification shows "Playing random favorite: [song title]"
   - Functionality still works correctly (plays random favorite)

3. Verify Export/Import removal:
   - Favorites tab only shows the Random button
   - No Export button visible
   - No Import button visible
   - Favorites can still be added and removed normally
   - Favorites persist in localStorage

## Notes

- The button ID `shuffleFavoritesBtn` was kept as-is to avoid breaking references
- The function name `getShuffledFavorites()` in the favorites module was kept as-is (internal implementation detail)
- Only user-facing text and comments were changed from "shuffle" to "random"
- Backup files and documentation files were not modified
- The `/src/js/modules/favorites/import-export.js` file was deleted (feature completely removed per user request)
- Users can no longer export or import their favorites (feature removed per user request)

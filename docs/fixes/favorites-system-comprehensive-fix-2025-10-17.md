# Favorites System Comprehensive Fix - October 17, 2025

## Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues with the favorites system across music library, search dropdown, and visual feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Channel Names in Song History (Recent/Most Played)
**Problem:**
- YouTube IFrame API's `getVideoData()` doesn't reliably return the `author` field
- Many videos showed "Unknown Channel" in Recent and Most Played tabs
- This affected ALL song history, not just favorites

**Solution:**
- Added fallback to YouTube oEmbed API when IFrame API doesn't provide channel name
- oEmbed endpoint (`https://www.youtube.com/oembed`) provides reliable `author_name` field
- No API key required, works for all public videos
- Asynchronous fetch doesn't block player loading
- Location: `src/js/modules/youtube/video-loader.js:153-166, 282-298`

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Check if channel name is missing after IFrame API call
if (!this.player.videoChannel || this.player.videoChannel.trim() === "") {
  // Fetch from oEmbed as fallback
  const channelName = await fetchChannelFromOEmbed(videoId);
  this.player.videoChannel = channelName || "Unknown Channel";
}
```

### 2. Duplicate Event Listeners in Music Library
**Problem:**
- `setupFavoriteButtons()` was being called inside `renderLibrary()` function
- Every time the library re-rendered (tab switch, popover open), a new event listener was added
- This caused duplicate listeners and potential conflicts

**Solution:**
- Moved `setupFavoriteButtons()` call outside of `renderLibrary()` to run only once during initialization
- Event delegation ensures listeners work even when DOM content is replaced
- Location: `src/js/ui/library-ui.js:57-66`

### 3. Duplicate Click Handlers for Song Cards
**Problem:**
- Individual click handlers were added to each `.song-card` element inside `renderLibrary()`
- Every re-render added new listeners, creating memory leaks and multiple executions

**Solution:**
- Implemented single event delegation handler on `libraryContent` container
- Handles clicks for:
  - Remove buttons (favorites tab)
  - Favorite items (favorites tab)
  - Song cards (recent/top tabs)
- Location: `src/js/ui/library-ui.js:68-139`

### 4. Channel Data Extraction Issue (Favorites Only)
**Problem:**
- `extractSongData()` prioritized DOM text content over data attributes
- Library song cards show "Channel Name • X plays" in text
- This resulted in "Unknown Channel • 5 plays" being stored instead of clean channel name

**Solution:**
- Reversed priority: now checks `data-channel` attribute first
- Falls back to DOM text parsing only if data attribute is missing
- Ensures clean channel names are captured from all song sources
- Location: `src/js/utils/favorite-button.js:116-150`

### 5. Heart Icon Visual Styling Not Applied
**Problem:**
- CSS targeted `svg` elements for icon styling
- Favorite buttons use Phosphor icon web fonts with `<i>` tags
- Icons were not receiving size, color, or filter effects
- Filled heart (when liked) was not visually distinct from empty heart

**Solution:**
- Updated all CSS selectors from `svg` to `i` tags
- Affects:
  - `.music-favorite-btn i` - main player favorite button
  - `.song-favorite-btn i` - inline song list favorite buttons
  - `.history-action-btn i` - favorites action buttons
- Now correctly applies:
  - Icon sizing (13px/14px/16px based on variant)
  - Pink color (#ff0096) when favorited
  - Drop shadow effects for visual emphasis
- Location: `src/css/components/favorites/favorites-buttons.css`

## Visual Changes

### Before
- Heart icon appeared the same whether song was liked or not
- No visual feedback when favoriting songs
- Channel names included play counts

### After
- **Liked songs:** Filled heart icon (`ph-heart-fill`) with bright pink color and strong glow
- **Not liked:** Empty heart outline (`ph-heart`) with subtle pink tint
- Clean channel names stored in favorites
- Proper visual hierarchy and feedback

## Files Modified

1. `src/js/modules/youtube/video-loader.js`
   - Added `fetchChannelFromOEmbed()` method
   - Fallback channel name fetching when IFrame API fails
   - Fixes "Unknown Channel" in all song history

2. `src/js/ui/library-ui.js`
   - Moved event listener setup outside render loop
   - Implemented event delegation for all click handlers
   - Removed 50+ lines of duplicate code

3. `src/js/utils/favorite-button.js`
   - Updated `extractSongData()` to prioritize data attributes
   - Fixed channel name extraction logic

4. `src/css/components/favorites/favorites-buttons.css`
   - Changed all `svg` selectors to `i` selectors (7 locations)
   - Ensures Phosphor icon fonts receive proper styling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Music Library - Recent Tab**
   - Click heart icon on songs → should add/remove from favorites
   - Heart should fill with pink glow when favorited
   - Switch tabs and verify favorites persist

2. **Music Library - Most Played Tab**
   - Same favorite functionality as Recent tab
   - Verify play counts display correctly

3. **Music Library - Favorites Tab**
   - Click X button to remove → should remove from favorites
   - Verify library re-renders without removed song
   - Badge count should update

4. **Search Dropdown**
   - Search for videos
   - Click heart icon → should add to favorites
   - Verify heart shows filled state immediately

5. **Data Integrity**
   - Add songs from different sources (search, library, current playing)
   - Check favorites in localStorage
   - Verify channel names are clean (no "• X plays")

## Performance Improvements

- **Before:** N event listeners added per render (where N = number of songs)
- **After:** 2 total event listeners (favorites + clicks) using delegation
- Significant memory usage reduction
- Faster re-renders due to less listener management

## Accessibility

- Maintained proper ARIA labels for all favorite buttons
- Clear visual distinction between favorited/not favorited states
- High contrast pink color meets WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation still functional with event delegation

# Favorite Icon Filled State Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Type:** UI Enhancement
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## Summary

Implemented a filled heart icon to visually distinguish liked songs from unliked songs. Previously, the heart icon only
changed color when a song was liked. Now it also switches from an outline to a filled version for better visual
feedback.

## Problem

The favorite/like button used a single outline heart icon (`favourite.svg`) for both liked and unliked states. The only
visual difference was the color change, which could be subtle and less intuitive for users.

## Solution

### 1. Created Filled Heart Icon

Created a new SVG icon with a filled appearance:

- **File:** `public/svg-icons/bookmark-favorite/favourite-filled.svg`
- **Design:** Same heart shape as the outline version, but with `fill="currentColor"` instead of just stroke

### 2. Updated Favorite Button Logic

Modified the favorite button rendering and state management to switch between icons:

#### In `src/js/utils/favorite-button.js`:

- **`createFavoriteButtonHTML()`**: Now selects the appropriate icon based on favorite state
    - Not liked: `favourite.svg` (outline)
    - Liked: `favourite-filled.svg` (filled)

- **`updateButtonState()`**: Updates the icon source when toggling favorite state
    - Finds the `img.svg-icon` element
    - Changes `src` attribute to match the new state

#### In `src/js/modules/favorites-ui/initialization.js`:

- **`updateFavoriteButton()`**: Updated to switch icons for the main music controls favorite button
    - Same logic as `updateButtonState()`
    - Ensures consistency across all favorite buttons

## Files Changed

1. **Created:**
    - `public/svg-icons/bookmark-favorite/favourite-filled.svg`

2. **Modified:**
    - `src/js/utils/favorite-button.js` (lines 23-35, 210-232)
    - `src/js/modules/favorites-ui/initialization.js` (lines 89-114)

## Visual Changes

### Before

- ü§ç Not liked: Outline heart (white/gray)
- üíó Liked: Outline heart (pink with glow)

### After

- ü§ç Not liked: Outline heart (white/gray)
- üíñ Liked: **Filled** heart (pink with glow)

## Testing

### Manual Testing

The changes are visual enhancements that don't affect functionality:

- Existing E2E tests in `tests/e2e/favorites.spec.js` still pass (they test functionality, not icon appearance)
- Manual testing confirmed:
    - ‚úÖ Heart starts as outline when song is not liked
    - ‚úÖ Heart switches to filled when song is liked
    - ‚úÖ Heart switches back to outline when unliked
    - ‚úÖ All instances of favorite buttons sync correctly (library, music controls, search)

### No Breaking Changes

- The functional behavior remains identical
- All event handlers work the same way
- localStorage operations unchanged
- The `favorited` CSS class is still applied for color styling

## Benefits

1. **Better Visual Feedback:** Users can instantly see which songs are favorited
2. **Industry Standard:** Filled/unfilled icons are a common pattern (like Twitter, Instagram)
3. **Accessibility:** Stronger visual distinction helps users with color vision deficiencies
4. **Consistency:** Both the inline song buttons and main control button use the same icon switching logic

## Notes

- The CSS styling (pink color, glow effects, animations) remains the same
- The icons use `currentColor` so they inherit the CSS color values
- Both icons have the same viewBox and proportions for seamless switching

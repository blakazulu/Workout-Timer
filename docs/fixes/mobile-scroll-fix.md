# Mobile Button Container Scroll Fix

## Issue
The entire button container area (including START, NEW TIMER, and CLEAR ALL buttons) was causing unwanted scrolling on mobile devices when touched. This was disrupting the user experience as the viewport would shift when interacting with any control buttons.

## Root Causes
1. Missing `touch-action` CSS property on button container and buttons
2. No touch-specific event handling
3. Body scrolling not disabled during timer operation
4. Footer and controls container allowing default touch behaviors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Touch-Action Properties
Added to multiple elements:
- `.controls` container in `src/css/components.css`
- `.btn` class in `src/css/components.css`
- `.app-footer` in `src/css/global.css`
Properties added:
- `touch-action: manipulation` - Prevents double-tap zoom and scroll
- `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` - Removes tap highlight
- `user-select: none` - Prevents text selection

### 2. Enhanced Touch Event Handling
Updated button event listeners in `src/js/app.js`:
- Added `touchstart` event prevention
- Added `touchend` as primary action trigger
- Applied to all timer control buttons (Start, New Timer, Clear All)
- Used `{ passive: false }` to allow preventDefault

### 3. Body Scroll Prevention
- Added `.timer-active` class in `src/css/global.css`
- Timer module now adds/removes this class appropriately
- Prevents body scrolling when timer is running

## Files Modified
- `/src/css/components.css` - Added touch-action properties to `.controls` container and `.btn` class
- `/src/css/global.css` - Added timer-active class and touch-action to `.app-footer`
- `/src/js/app.js` - Enhanced touch event handling for all control buttons
- `/src/js/modules/timer.js` - Added body class management for scroll control

## Testing Notes
- Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Verify entire button container area doesn't cause scrolling
- Test all buttons (Start, New Timer, Clear All) for proper touch handling
- Ensure timer can still be paused/resumed
- Check that scrolling works normally when timer is not active

## Result
Mobile users can now interact with the entire button container area without experiencing unwanted scrolling. The fix covers the complete footer region including all control buttons, ensuring consistent behavior across all touch devices while maintaining desktop compatibility.

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Type**: Feature Redesign
**Status**: Complete
**Files Modified**:

- `/mnt/c/My Stuff/workout-timer-pro/src/partials/popovers/plan-builder.html`
- `/mnt/c/My Stuff/workout-timer-pro/src/js/ui/plan-builder.js`
- `/mnt/c/My Stuff/workout-timer-pro/src/css/components/plans.css`
- `/mnt/c/My Stuff/workout-timer-pro/tests/e2e/plan-builder.spec.js`

## Problem Statement

The previous custom plan builder was overly complex with:

- 3-step wizard with progress indicator
- Quick-add buttons with smart defaults
- Visual timeline component
- Inline segment editor panel with advanced options (intensity, sound cues)
- Intensity selectors (1-5 scale)
- Sound cue selectors
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Preset duplication from within builder
- Smart tips system
- Multiple navigation paths

This complexity made the feature difficult to use and maintain, with too many options overwhelming users who just wanted
to create a simple custom workout.

## Solution Overview

Completely redesigned the custom plan builder into a **dead simple 2-step workflow**:

### Step 1: Segments Setup

Users add workout segments one at a time:

1. Click "Add Segment"
2. Select segment type from dropdown (5 types only)
3. Enter duration in seconds
4. Click "Add to Plan"
5. Repeat for additional segments
6. Edit or delete existing segments as needed
7. View total duration
8. Click "Next" when done

### Step 2: Plan Details

Users provide plan information:

1. Enter plan name (required)
2. Add description (optional)
3. Set total set repetitions (1-99, default 1)
4. Set alert time (0-60 seconds, default 3)
5. Click "Save Plan"

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure (`plan-builder.html`)

**Removed**:

- 3-step wizard with progress indicator
- Quick-add buttons
- Visual timeline component
- Inline segment editor panel
- Intensity sliders
- Sound cue selectors
- Advanced options sections
- Preset duplication interface

**Added**:

- Clean 2-step layout
- Single "Add Segment" button
- Inline segment configuration form (appears on demand)
- Vertical list of segment cards with edit/delete buttons
- Prominent total duration display
- Simple step navigation (Cancel/Next, Back/Save)

**Key Features**:

- Only 5 segment types: Prepare, Warm-up, Work, Rest, Cool-down
- One segment configuration at a time
- Clear visual feedback for each step
- Mobile-optimized touch targets (44px minimum)

### JavaScript Logic (`plan-builder.js`)

**Simplified State Management**:

```javascript
const builderState = {
  currentStep: 1, // 1 or 2
  segments: [], // Array of {type, duration}
  isAddingSegment: false, // True when segment config is shown
  editingSegmentIndex: null, // Index when editing existing segment
  planDetails: {
    name: '',
    description: '',
    repetitions: 1,
    alertTime: 3
  },
  isEditMode: false,
  currentPlanId: null
};
```

**Key Behaviors**:

- "Add Segment" button disabled while configuration is shown
- "Add to Plan" button enabled only when type AND duration are set
- "Next" button enabled only when at least 1 segment added
- Segment list shows type badge, duration, edit/delete buttons
- Edit opens the config section with existing values
- Delete removes immediately (no confirmation dialog)
- Total duration updates automatically whenever segments change

**Removed Features**:

- Complex intensity mapping (1-5 scale)
- Sound cue configuration
- Duration unit toggle (seconds/minutes)
- Duplicate segment functionality
- Smart tips system
- Visual timeline rendering
- Inline panel animations
- Segment type dropdown population with categories

**New Features**:

- Default duration suggestions based on segment type
- Duration hint display (e.g., "Default: 5 min")
- Clean segment card rendering with colored type badges
- Straightforward validation
- Simple format duration utility (e.g., "5 min 30 sec")

### CSS Styling (`plans.css`)

**Removed** (reduced from 2719 lines to 728 lines):

- Wizard progress indicator styles
- Quick-add button grid layouts
- Visual timeline block styles
- Inline panel slide animations
- Complex intensity slider styles
- Advanced options accordion styles
- Drag-and-drop placeholder styles
- Multi-step transition animations

**Added**:

- Clean add segment section with bordered container
- Inline segment config with fade-in animation
- Segment card list with colored type badges
- Total duration display with prominent styling
- Form field styles for step 2
- Navigation button styles (Cancel, Back, Next, Save)
- Mobile-responsive breakpoints for touch optimization

**Design System**:

- Consistent cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors
- Color-coded segment type badges:
    - **Prepare**: Blue (#6464ff)
    - **Warm-up**: Orange (#ff9600)
    - **Work**: Magenta (#ff0096)
    - **Rest**: Cyan (#00ffc8)
    - **Cool-down**: Light Blue (#64c8ff)
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Focus states with glow effects
- Smooth transitions throughout

### Test Coverage (`plan-builder.spec.js`)

Completely rewrote E2E tests to match new 2-step workflow:

**Test Suites**:

1. **Opening and Closing** (5 tests)
    - Open from My Plans tab
    - Close with close button
    - Show correct title
    - Start on Step 1

2. **Step 1: Add Segments** (11 tests)
    - Show/hide segment config
    - Enable/disable buttons correctly
    - Populate duration defaults
    - Add segments to list
    - Update total duration
    - Enable Next button
    - Edit existing segments
    - Delete segments

3. **Step 2: Plan Details** (5 tests)
    - Show form fields
    - Default values
    - Back to Step 1
    - Validate required fields
    - Save plan

4. **Complete Workflow** (1 test)
    - Create full plan with multiple segments
    - Verify all data saved correctly

**Total Tests**: 22 comprehensive E2E tests

## Segment Type Defaults

```javascript
{
  prepare: { duration: 120, name: "Prepare" },      // 2 minutes
  warmup: { duration: 300, name: "Warm-up" },       // 5 minutes
  work: { duration: 30, name: "Work" },             // 30 seconds
  rest: { duration: 15, name: "Rest" },             // 15 seconds
  cooldown: { duration: 300, name: "Cool-down" }    // 5 minutes
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Step 1: Segments

- At least 1 segment must be added to proceed
- Each segment must have both type and duration
- Duration must be 1-3600 seconds

### Step 2: Plan Details

- Plan name is required (minimum 3 characters)
- Repetitions: 1-99
- Alert time: 0-60 seconds
- Description is optional (max 500 characters)

## Analytics Events

Tracked events for monitoring usage:

- `plan_builder:opened` - {isEditMode}
- `plan_builder:add_segment_clicked`
- `plan_builder:segment_added` - {type, duration}
- `plan_builder:segment_edited` - {type, duration}
- `plan_builder:segment_deleted` - {type, segmentCount}
- `plan_builder:segment_edit_started` - {index}
- `plan_builder:step_completed` - {step: 1}
- `plan_builder:step_back` - {from: 2, to: 1}
- `plan_builder:saved` - {planId, planName, segmentCount, totalDuration, repetitions}

## Mobile Optimization

# Sound Timing Improvements

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Issue**: Timer not waiting for sounds, alert beeps skipping last second
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Alert Beeps Skipping Last Second
**Before**: Beeps played at 3s, 2s only (skipped 1s)
**After**: Beeps play at 3s, 2s, 1s, then transition sound at 0s

**User Feedback**: "If I put 3 seconds alert it starts at 3, 2, 1 - it should tick on all of them"

**Fix**: Changed condition from `currentTime > 1` to `currentTime > 0`
- Location: `timer.js:336`
- Now plays alert on all countdown seconds (3, 2, 1)
- Transition sound plays separately at 0

### 2. Timer Not Waiting for Transition Sounds
**Before**: Timer immediately continued to next period while sound was still playing
**After**: Timer pauses until transition sound finishes, then continues

**User Feedback**: "When it's done - play the sound - when the sound is done - start the next timer"

**Implementation**:
1. Clear interval when timer reaches 0
2. Play transition sound with callback
3. Resume interval when sound finishes

## Technical Changes

### Audio Module (`audio.js`)

**Added callback support to playSound()**:
```javascript
playSound(soundKey, onEnded = null) {
  // ... existing logic ...

  // Add ended callback if provided
  if (onEnded) {
    const endHandler = () => {
      sound.removeEventListener("ended", endHandler);
      onEnded();
    };
    sound.addEventListener("ended", endHandler);
  }

  sound.play().catch((error) => {
    // Call callback even on error to prevent timer from hanging
    if (onEnded) onEnded();
  });
}
```

**Updated wrapper methods**:
```javascript
playRestEnd(onEnded)
playComplete(onEnded)
playFinalComplete(onEnded)
```

All now accept optional callback that executes when sound finishes.

### Timer Module (`timer.js`)

**Modified handleTimerComplete()**:

**Rest End Flow**:
```javascript
// Clear interval
clearInterval(this.interval);

// Play whistle with callback
this.audio.playRestEnd(() => {
  // Update state
  this.isResting = false;
  this.currentRep++;
  this.currentTime = this.duration;

  // Update timestamp
  const now = Date.now();
  this.targetEndTime = now + (this.currentTime * 1000);

  // Update display
  this.updateDisplay();

  // Restart interval
  this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
});
```

**Round End Flow**:
```javascript
clearInterval(this.interval);

this.audio.playComplete(() => {
  if (this.restTime > 0) {
    // Start rest period
    this.isResting = true;
    this.currentTime = this.restTime;
    this.targetEndTime = Date.now() + (this.restTime * 1000);
    this.updateDisplay();

    // Restart interval
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  } else {
    // No rest, go directly to next rep
    this.currentRep++;
    this.currentTime = this.duration;
    this.targetEndTime = Date.now() + (this.duration * 1000);
    this.updateDisplay();

    // Restart interval
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }
});
```

**Workout Complete Flow**:
```javascript
clearInterval(this.interval);

this.audio.playFinalComplete(() => {
  // Stop timer after sound finishes
  this.stop();
});
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
```
Countdown: 3 (beep), 2 (beep), 1 (silence)
At 0: Bell sound starts
Immediately: Timer shows next period while bell still playing
User confusion: "Did the round end? Why is timer already running?"
```

### After
```
Countdown: 3 (beep), 2 (beep), 1 (beep)
At 0: Bell sound plays
Timer pauses: Display stays at 0:00 until bell finishes
When bell ends: Timer shows new period and starts counting
Clear feedback: Sound fully indicates transition
```

## Sound Sequence Example

**3-round workout with rest**:

1. **Round 1 Work**:
   - 3s: Beep
   - 2s: Beep
   - 1s: Beep
   - 0s: Boxing bell plays → Timer pauses at 0:00

2. **Bell finishes** → Display updates to "REST"

3. **Rest Period**:
   - 3s: Beep
   - 2s: Beep
   - 1s: Beep
   - 0s: Whistle plays → Timer pauses at 0:00

4. **Whistle finishes** → Display updates to "Rep 2/3"

5. *...continues for all rounds...*

6. **Final Round Complete**:
   - 0s: Three bells play → Timer pauses
   - **Three bells finish** → Timer stops, shows "✓ Complete!"

## Debug Output

With debug mode enabled (`window.enableTimerDebug()`):

```
[Timer] Alert beep at 3s
[Timer] Alert beep at 2s
[Timer] Alert beep at 1s
[Timer] Round 1 complete, playing bell...
[Audio] Playing roundEnd (original)
[Audio] roundEnd finished playing
[Timer] Starting rest period (5s)
```

Notice:
- All 3 beeps logged (3, 2, 1)
- Sound starts
- Sound finishes (callback fired)
- Timer resumes

## Error Handling

**Sound fails to play**:
- Callback still fires to prevent timer from hanging
- Timer continues normally even if sound errors

**Sound takes too long**:
- Timer waits indefinitely (by design)
- Sound duration is typically 1-2 seconds, acceptable delay

**User interaction required** (browser autoplay policy):
- First sound may fail without user interaction
- Subsequent sounds work after user starts workout
- Error logged but timer continues

## Files Modified

1. **src/js/modules/audio.js**
   - Added `onEnded` parameter to `playSound()` (line 103)
   - Added event listener cleanup logic (lines 124-131)
   - Updated wrapper methods (lines 227, 236, 245)
   - Clone cleanup also calls callback (lines 158-163)

2. **src/js/modules/timer.js**
   - Changed alert condition to `> 0` (line 336)
   - Modified `handleTimerComplete()` to pause/resume interval (lines 356-501)
   - Added callback-based flow for all transitions
   - Improved debug logging

## Performance Impact

**Additional Operations**:
- `clearInterval()` on each transition: <1ms
- `addEventListener('ended')` per sound: <1ms
- Callback execution: <1ms

**Total Delay per Transition**: 1-2 seconds (sound duration)
- This is intentional and improves UX
- User clearly hears and understands transition
- No confusion about timer state

**No Performance Degradation**:
- Interval cleared during sound = less CPU usage
- No duplicate timers running
- Clean state transitions

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Alert beeps play at 3, 2, 1 (all three)
- [x] Transition sound plays at 0
- [x] Timer pauses during transition sound
- [x] Timer resumes after sound finishes
- [x] Works for rest end (whistle)
- [x] Works for round end (bell)
- [x] Works for workout end (three bells)
- [x] No rest period handled correctly
- [x] Sound errors don't hang timer
- [x] Debug logging shows correct flow

## Known Behavior

**Timer Display at 0**:
- Display shows "0:00" during transition sound
- This is correct - user knows period ended
- When sound finishes, display updates to next period

**Sound Duration**:
- Whistle: ~1.0s
- Bell: ~1.2s
- Three bells: ~2.0s

These delays are acceptable and improve UX by providing clear audio feedback.

## Related Improvements

This fix complements:
1. Memory leak fix (audio clone cleanup)
2. Non-blocking audio playback
3. Debug logging system
4. Performance optimizations

Together, these create a smooth, professional timer experience with clear audio cues.
